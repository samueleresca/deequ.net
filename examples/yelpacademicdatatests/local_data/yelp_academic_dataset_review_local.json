When I saw they would be showing infamous eggs of the House of Faberge from the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts (VMFA), I knew I had to go!\n\nTucked away near the gelateria and the garden, the Gallery is pretty much hidden from view. It's what real estate agents would call \"cozy\" or \"charming\" - basically any euphemism for small.\n\nThat being said, you can still see wonderful art at a gallery of any size, so why the two *s you ask? Let me tell you:\n\n* pricing for this, while relatively inexpensive for a Las Vegas attraction, is completely over the top. For the space and the amount of art you can fit in there, it is a bit much.\n* it's not kid friendly at all. Seriously, don't bring them.\n* the security is not trained properly for the show. When the curating and design teams collaborate for exhibitions, there is a definite flow. That means visitors should view the art in a certain sequence, whether it be by historical period or cultural significance (this is how audio guides are usually developed). When I arrived in the gallery I could not tell where to start, and security was certainly not helpful. I was told to \"just look around\" and \"do whatever.\" \n\nAt such a *fine* institution, I find the lack of knowledge and respect for the art appalling.","date":"2015-04-15 05:21:16"}

My 3 year old son needed a haircut this past summer and the lure of the $7 kids cut signs got me in the door. We had to wait a few minutes as both stylists were working on people. The decor in this place is total garbage. It is so tacky. The sofa they had at the time was a pleather sofa with giant holes in it. And my son noticed ants crawling all over the floor and the furniture. It was disgusting and I should have walked out then. Actually, I should have turned around and walked out upon entering but I didn't. So the older black male stylist finishes the haircut he was doing and it's our turn. I tell him I want a #2 clipper around the back and sides and then hand cut the top into a standard boys cut. Really freaking simple, right? WRONG! Rather than use the clippers and go up to actually cut the hair, he went down. Using it moving downward doesn't cut hair, it just rubs against it. How does this man who has an alleged cosmetology license not know how to use a set of freaking clippers??? I realized almost immediately that he had no idea what he was doing. No idea at all. After about 10 minutes of watching this guy stumble through it, I said \"you know what? That's fine.\", paid and left. All I wanted to do was get out of that scummy joint and take my son to a real haircut place.\n\nBottom line: DO NOT GO HERE. RUN THE OTHER WAY!!!!!","date":"2013-12-07 03:16:52"}

We were not disappointed.\n\nI am a bit of an amateur chef myself and consider my palate to be fairly sophisticated when it comes to all kinds of South Asian cuisine. This is not authentic Indian food - we don't have rice and salad bowls - but it is good, wholesome, high quality Indian food.\n\nI ordered a bowl of rice, yellow daal and the koftas (meatballs). The daal was perfect, the way daal should be cooked. The koftas were a little bland for my taste, but otherwise not bad...soft and the right texture. Paired with the many sauces and onions and the whole dish was wholesome and rich and very filling. My friend ordered the biryani, which, while not bad, still isn't the way real biryani should be, and I come from a city known for its biryani - but then I still haven't found a single place in America that makes biryani the way they do it back home.\n\nThe ambiance is good and there's plenty of room to sit. The line moves quickly and at most you'll face a 10-15 min wait on a crowded day. The only issue I had was with the music - being a designer, it bothers me that the music selection to go with such great interiors  could have been better...I would expect Bollywood classics or Indian classical fusion instead of the usual loud pop music.\n\nTldr: if you're looking for authentically prepared and presented Indian food you'll be disappointed. If you're looking for high quality Indian-American food, this is a great place to get it. Will be coming back to try their tikka masala and chicken next.\n\nUpdate: went there again with a bunch of friends and tried their chicken tikka masala and pav bhaji.

I was hungry and Caesars Palace was a across from where I was staying and all the restaurants in my hotel were packed and had lines, I walked right in with no waiting. (I will assume now that since its Bobby's place this place can get crowded so I feel the need to note this was a Sunday about 11:45am) Once inside Caesars Palace, I went to the first restaurant I saw, which was this one.  I realized mid-meal it was his restaurant when the waiter at the table next to me was explaining to the recently seated couple that \"Mr Flay likes a little spice so beware all of our dishes have a little kick\" (they were an older couple). I know i'm slow after he said that, that's when i realized why they had his cookbooks in the front. :)  (but like i said had a horrible trip so i wasn't even looking for things like this) anyway onto the food.\n\nFOOD: fantastic.  I went on sunday and i got the eggs and aged striploin tortilla (fancy name for steak and eggs) and  it was yummy.  It came with all this spices of sorts (well they werent spices). I am not really sure how to describe it, more like the consistency of salsa's but they werent salsa's, at any rate it was really good mix with the eggs.  I had a side of home fries which were a little burnt but oh well.  The steak was very good, very flavored, moist and tender. Overall very good. Had a cappuccino too, also very good.

I don't know what the problem is - I have worked in the industry before while in college and I would say front of the house training needs big overhaul.  At any rate, they have lots of TV's and it is closer to us but just plain not good.  I wish they would switch locations with Wild Wing Cafe - also chain-y but much better food and service.","date":"2016-04-11 16:42:13"}

See, we chose not to make reservations, but instead just wing it and see where we could get in. They had some early dining availability, so we jumped on it. Their special New Year's \"Paint the Town Gold\" menu did not disappoint.\n\nLocated in the beautiful Mandalay Bay restaurant row, Kumi is a gorgeous display of style and food artistry. Every course was surprisingly delicious, and plated interestingly.\n\nService was very good, seriously on point. Right up until the dessert course...after 30 minutes of waiting for it, we finally requested the check as we had an event to get to. One of our attendants felt bad and offered to quickly grab it for us but we were in danger of being late so we opted not to take him up on it. \n\nIt's a beautiful, albeit very pricey experience for dinner. We would return for special occasions only.","date":"2017-01-02 05:24:56"}

Oh, how things have changed.\n\nThere are some goods, however.  If you are a conventioneer, you have instant and direct walking access to the main convention center.  But don't think about parking here for said conventions.  $30 a day for parking, Hilton?  Seriously?  That's robbery.  And greed.\n\nThe biggest disappointment is the killing off of Star Trek: The Experience over two years ago.  Despite this place being off-Strip, I made it a point to go here because they had such a fun and unique attraction here.  It would be one thing if they had something in mind to replace it, but either poor planning or the economy.... It's dead, Jim. \n\nThe \"Space Lounge\" is still there.  An entire casino area with a heavy sci-fi theme to it.  Except there's no casino here.  It's a huge space themed area with a ghost town bar, no slots, a few couches, a makeshift stage, beer signs, and a few remnants of Star Trek themes.  All of this space, and nothing.  No life to it.  Couches and beer signs only make the emptiness and waste of the area seem more empty and pathetic.\n\nWith their main draw gone, what has replaced it as the headliner?  Benihana's.  Nothing wrong with the restaurant, but it's hardly unique or exclusive, even in Vegas.  The Hilton has a Pizza Hut Express here too.  Maybe they should promote that as their \"big draw\" on the marquee as well.  A huge Benihana sign covers up the old entrance to Star Trek.  With couches pushed in front of the entryway.  Again, just sad, and I'll be a big man in saying that they kind of broke my heart getting rid of one of my most beloved hang-outs here.\n\nThe arcade is dead as well.  Another blanketed off space that sits and collects dust.  Again, with two-plus years, no suitable replacement has been found for anything in this section.  A few shops that fluctuate, but that's it.  This is a lot of dead space to go unused.  \n\nThere's also the issue of the Men's bathroom in the main casino area.  Above every urinal is a picture of a lust-crazed girl staring over your bits with a camera, magnifying glass, tape measure, etc, while you pee.  The first time I saw this, it was \"ha ha\" funny, then when the laughter died, it just turned creepy and weird for me.  I actually selected a urinal based off which girl creeped me out the least.  She merely looked like she was casting spells at my nethers.  I could live with that.\n\nLadies: I must know.  Is there something like this in the girl's restroom?  When you close the stall door to do your business, is there a picture of some crazed guy making grabbing motions where your boobs would be?  Please message me and let me know.  I'd really like to know what the Hell you get in your bathroom after my gender's discovery.\n\nAs critical as I am being, there looks to be some sort of steampunk-themed club called \"Triumph\" there.  I want to check this out.  Atonement for the death of my beloved Warp Core Breach booze bowl?  We'll see, but it's going to have to be pretty good to replace the hole in my heart from that much booze for so cheap a price.\n\nThe sad part is, Hilton's one of those \"history rich\" casinos here.  Look up the history on this place.  A lot of awesome stars and vintage Vegas stuff happened here, which makes you wonder why this isn't represented more.\n\nThis place is great for convention visitors to stay, but that's about it as far as I can see.  They need to figure themselves out for everything else.","date":"2011-01-09 00:09:50"}

I went to Huntersville Ford yesterday to get an oil change on my commuter car.  Paid my $41.00 and was given back my car just over an hour later.\nToday I had to go to work (40 mile round trip commute).  As I was getting off of I-85, I noticed the smell of burning oil.  I thought maybe the tech just spilled a little on the exhaust manifold since it's right there, and maybe it's burning off.  I didn't hit a stop light until I was almost at my office.  When I stopped and was waiting for the light, my cabin started to fill with smoke, and I had smoke pouring out from under the hood and the wheel wells as well.\nI pulled over into the parking area of a gas station (because they have accessible fire extinguishers) and parked.  I popped the hood only to find THE TECHNICIAN DID NOT PUT THE OIL FILLER CAP BACK ON!!!  Now my engine is covered in potentially flammable oil, and of course Huntersville Ford is closed today!!!!\nI have my car sitting outside in the parking lot with the hood open, just in case it decides to ignite, because my engine is pretty hot after a 20 mile drive.\nI called and left a voicemail, and now I have to find a way to degrease my engine at work, just so I can drive it home in a less-flammable state.  I WILL HOLD HUNTERSVILLE FORD RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY COMPONENTS THAT FAIL AS OF A RESULT OF THIS.  Most electronics don't like being slathered in motor oil.  In fact, I'm pretty sure they aren't designed for that.\n\nAnd NO, I did not have other work done... Just the oil change.  You had 1 job.... oil change.

This time, I ordered the following - duck crepe (SOOOO good!), shrimp tamale (very flavorful and fresh), salmon (mediocre, at best... and our waiter even told us not to order it... but my friend didn't listen), and halibut (tender, flaky, not fishy at all... and so flavorful!).  The halibut and appetizers were my favorites and I would definitely go and order those again.  We also ordered 3 desserts, which were totally worth it!  Sweet potato pudding (and I don't even like sweet potatoes!), Banana pie tart thingy, and spicy peanut chocolate cake.  mmmmmm would definitely go there for dessert and the appetizers!!! \n\nYou need a reservation for this place.","date":"2012-11-06 06:00:13"}

My daughter's go to is a strawberry banana smoothie and the menu had a few smoothies that had strawberry and banana mixed with other stuff and I asked if they would be able to make one with just strawberry and banana and she had said they couldn't because it was already pre made. So we continued to look at the menu and a different girl came and said she would be able to make the smoothie so thank you to her. My husband and I knew we wanted to get an acai bowl so as\nwe looked at the different options we found one we wanted to try but on the menu it had a pitaya and we asked if we could get it with acai instead but again was told that it was already pre made. So we went with one that was made with acai but it had blueberries which we don't like and we weee hesistant to ask if they would be able to leave them out since everything seemed to be pre made but my husband did ask and luckily she said they could leave it out. Whew! It wasn't a long wait to get our order. My daughter drank her smoothie saying it was okay and our acai bowl was okay as well. To\nme the best part was the granola and that's about it.

Every restaurant was packed before the show, so we set on wandering MGM afterwards for a good after show nosh and were definitely pleased at Crush. Luckily we were seated right away (not many people ordering dinner at 11pm I suppose!) and our incredibly nice server saw to our drink order ASAP.\n\nThe ambience is tres chic. Dark, romantic, and removed from casino craziness in the back where we sat cuddled up in a booth. The only negative about our seats was the pretty chilly draft, but perhaps we were just too sober ;) The Syrah was absolutely delicious, and at $11 for a glass, a Vegas bargain. We began with the Caesar salad which came out within minutes of ordering and was very tasty, though I myself found the sweetness to be a little strange. Overall it was a crunchy, refreshing delight. We then shared a margherita flatbread and the gnocchi. Whoa....both dishes definitely exceeded expectations. They were small plates, but really perfect for sharing. The speed at which the salad was delivered was slightly misleading, as the other dishes took quite a while to come out. However, they were clearly exceptionally fresh when they arrived.\n\nOur waiter was pretty busy but as attentive as he could be, and very professional without being overbearing. The end-to-end experience was more than I expected at such a large venue, and thus deserves a high recommendation. This was a perfect way to wind down from an energizing show without losing the dazzle of a getaway weekend with your honey.","date":"2014-08-10 23:03:05"}

To sum it up, the experience was so darn good that I wish I had more time on the plane.","date":"2010-01-08 09:36:25"}

I won't deny my dog needed some serious grooming.  We'd brushed him out the night before but he could still use more combing, his hind legs\/butt trimmed up and he had some matts behind his ear.  There are 4 doors at this place, I believe. If you just pull in to the drive way it's not terribly clear until you get closer to the doors and see signs directing you which to go into.  The lobby is cute. I was quickly greeted and I was given a form to complete. The woman doing the grooming introduced herself and I asked that his hind legs and butt get trimmed up and asked that she cut out any matts.  She said it would probably take about 3 hours.  I received a text about 3 1\/2 hours later stating the price would be $80 and if I returned within 8 weeks it would be $65.  I went to pick him up and I was shocked that they shaved him.  His hair was NOT that bad.  Not to mention the hair that was left was not soft as it has been after visiting other groomers.  I didn't say anything because I was so shocked in the moment so I took him home.  We saw our dog paying particular attention to his private area...more so than he usually does.  My husband looked closer and found that he had been nicked a couple of times.  We found a large cut behind one of his ears.  We won't be returning.","date":"2016-03-07 00:34:42"}

This review was tough to give, as it could've been anywhere between 2 and 4 stars.\n\nLet's start with the positives. I came here with a friend for Summerlicious this afternoon at 12:30, and we got the last seat in the restaurant (it helped that we reserved). We were given the menu and our order was taken in about 3-4 minutes. Not bad to start.\n\nI ordered the miso soup, green salad, ebi shiumai, sushi\/sashimi\/maki, and green tea ice cream. The miso soup and green salad tasted nothing special (the soup was a little salty though). The ebi shiumai tasted really good! The sushi\/sashimi\/maki tasted very good as well, and I especially love how there's a much higher raw fish-rice ratio compared to other restaurants I go to. Finally, the green tea ice cream was a great dessert to finish.\n\nEverything with the food satisfied me. The service, after having the order taken, was a near disaster. I understand it was a busy day today due to the fact it was a nice Friday, but many of the servers were confused in their roles. There was a long lineup of orders by the sushi counter, and at one point I saw 15 dishes lining up ready for serving, but no servers were going to pick them up. I didn't receive my shiumai until 1:00, and my sushi\/sashimi\/maki until around 1:20. I finished everything by around 1:30, but the ice cream didn't come until around 1:40, and finally the bill didn't come till around 1:55. After 1 hour and 35 minutes, I finally left the restaurant at 2:05, since I had to ask for the credit card machine, in which no server was around for about 8 minutes before I finally got one's attention.\n\nWhat probably saved this from a 2-star (or even a 1-star rating) was the fact the manager came out to me as I was signing my receipt saying how they were horribly understaffed and completely underestimated the demand for Summerlicious this year. They only had two sushi chefs, four servers, and two chefs serving what was a full house restaurant. In a way I felt bad, but I did give them just less than 10% tips; something I almost never do in restaurant.\n\nFree wifi! Password is the phone number. Perhaps as a sucker for free wifi that might have contributed to the 3-star rating I gave. However, be warned.","date":"2013-07-13 00:57:45"}

I ordered the hangover burger, and they not only asked how I wanted my burger (can choose from medium to well-done) but the worker even asked how runny I wanted the fried egg and then if I wanted it sunny side up or if they should flip it over easy. My buddy asked for mustard, and they even asked whether he wanted regular yellow, dijon, whole grain, or honey mustard. I added sweet potato fries for the $1 upcharge because I love sweet potato fries, paid my $10 and waited. I must say I was a little disappointed that I had to wait 15 minutes for the burger, but after first bite I had no more complaints!\nI don't know what's in Pat LaFreida's beef mixture, but it was the highest quality beef in a burger I've ever ordered. The bun was ridiculously soft as well. The egg was cooked perfectly, but the burger lacked any flavor from the small slice of cheese or the bacon hash unfortunately. Despite that, the amazing quality still made this burger awesome. \nThe sweet potato fries were by far the best sweet potato fries I've ever eaten, and I love sweet potato fries so that says a lot. They were crispy which so many places cannot accomplish and had a balance of sweetness from the fries and salt that was perfect. They came with a decent maple sauce, but I didn't dip very many because they were honestly better on their own. I must say, the bang bang sauce that comes on the side of the burgers is incredible though. It's similar to a Thousand Island dressing without the pickle relish, but something about it just makes it so much better and slightly sweeter. \nOverall, I probably wouldn't order the hangover again and would choose a more flavorful\/interesting option. I would also recommend going with a double if you're hungry because each patty is only around 4 ounces. Despite these slight \"drawbacks\", the quality of the meat and bun stood out so much that I think any burger here would be amazing and for a pretty solid price as well.","date":"2015-06-08 18:56:14"}

I blame the Marriot for most of the mess but the City of Tempe need to plan better for events.\nInside the stadium I found the place to be less than average for Spring Training games.  The food was not good, the customer service was average and we could not hear the speakers very well.  I will stick to other Spring Training facilities to see some games in the future.","date":"2014-04-01 02:10:32"}

I went in, placed my order, and after about 15 minutes, was on my way home. \n\nThe inside is cozy, there is a new hookah lounge upstairs (not technically the same business), for those who might be interested in that. The tables inside were pretty low key, but the kitchen area is open except for some glass, so you get to watch your food prepared while you wait which is always a nice touch. Some people don't like that, but I do, it forces restaurants to practice more hygienic practices because customers can see more. \n\nThe young lady who rang me up was helpful and friendly. The gentleman who gave me my food, apologized for the wait (15 minutes is not long in my book, but maybe for some it is), and said that calling ahead is a great option if you're ever in a hurry in the future. \n\nI ordered a lamb and chicken shish kabob. They were both DELICIOUS. Many kabobs in this city are incredibly bland and under seasoned, definitely not the case here. The rice was also well flavored. The green sauce that was at the counter where you pick up your food was perfectly spiced and I put it on EVERYTHING! I appreciate the fresh lemon wedge that was included in my to-go container. \n\nMy only real complaint was the price. It was more than $17 for two kabobs, which I thought was on the expensive side. If they took their prices down around $2, I'd be here way more often that is good for my wallet...","date":"2016-03-06 23:58:31"}

The prime rib was balanced with just the perfect amount of richness and seasoning. I ordered a medium and it was a true medium- the edges were seasoned and done well while the interior was still a soft pink and juicy. My date loved the Yorkshire pudding, I wasn't really a fan, but it was airy and puffed up to perfection. The mushrooms were rich and earthy, the perfect accompaniment. The mashed potatoes were smooth, creamy, and deliciously well seasoned. No bland taters here.\n\nAll in all, we had a truly wonderful evening at Lawry's LV. We decided to skip dessert because we were stuffed and totally satisfied, so our waiter went the extra mile and boxed up a mini cake for us saying that we couldn't leave without something sweet on our anniversary (!!)

When I objected to being relegated to reading with one eye with my new glasses, the reply was...\"Well, then you'll have to see the Dr. again, and no, he is not available now.\"  No offer to look up his schedule and see when I could see him again, or see if another Dr. could see me then to resolve it.  After the poor response to the problem (you would think they would have some professional way to deal with when glasses come back from the mfr\/lens maker and there is an unexpected issue).  I told them I'm not a patient here any longer and took my useless glasses home and resolved to find a quality optometry office and start over.

So I called again and toild them to toss my file out and not contact me again for any future appts. \n Another thing about their exams.....as part of your exam, they offer to take optional (extra cost) retina photos so you can also have a look at your retinas on a computer screen with the Dr., using a clumsy cube-shaped camera. You sit there and they have you smush your face up against a flat glass panel on the front while they take repeated attempts to get a good photo of your retina. They charge extra if you want this option. Then they raised the price, and I declined due to raising the price. They were charging plenty for that option already.  I moved to a different office that does not charge anything extra at all for the retina photos, and uses a better camera than the camera cube, so no more smushing my face against a flat glass window.\n(Note: using fake name here for privacy protection from internet identity thieves.)","date":"2018-07-17 00:21:32"}

Everything from start to finish was pretty much impeccable. \n\nSourdough bread in the shape of leaves were brought out immediately with softened butter in a small ramekin.  One thing I hate is when warm bread is brought out with butter that is ice cold and hard to spread on the bread, so I really appreciated that the butter was the right temperature to easily spread.\n\nFor a starter, we split the Terrine of foie gras which was delicious.  It has a thin layer of braised beef ground down to a coarse pate texture, then a thin layer of foie gras, then a layer of prune gelee.  Served with crostini and a small frisee salad.  The slightly slightly saltier beef and the creamy foie went so well together. The prune gelee added that touch of cool sweetness that made it all work together.  A dish I would definitely recommend.\n\nFor our entrees, I got the Steak frites, and Mark H had the Leg of lamb (Gigot d'Agneau.)  Mine was hangar steak topped with caramelized onions served with a compound butter and a healthy portion of nicely crispy, thinly cut fries.  The steak was cooked to a perfect mid rare and was tender.  The onions and the compound butter did overpower the steak a bit, though.\n\nMark H's dish on the other hand, was the better of the two.  The roasted leg of lamb was just so tender and flavorful,  the knife cut through the meat like butter.  The lamb was served with flageolet beans and braised escarole.  Our server asked him when he was ordering if he wanted any sides to go with it since it didn't come with a starch but the beans and escarole was enough for an entree portion.  Besides, I know he wanted to save room for dessert.\n\nFor dessert, we split the Banana crepe gateau.  Layers of crepes with banana pastry cream between them, served with salted caramel and french vanilla gelato.   This was pretty amazing as well.  I've had some fantasic gateau de crepes in france and this one really reminded me of being there.  The banana flavor was a bit too subtle for me but that salted caramel was like heaven.  Such an incredible texture to it with that bright kick of salt, damn.  The french vanilla gelato was memorable as well.  Nice silky texture and oh so creamy.\n\nThe next time I'm there,  we really have to try their breakfast.","date":"2016-01-04 04:06:15"}

The salmon salad came with a huge piece of fresh, healthy tasting salmon filet. It was just what I wanted. \n\nThe one wrinkle was that I wanted to swap something out of my salad for avocado instead (which came with the grilled shrimp salad but I wanted salmon, and not shrimp). The server told me they didn't do \"those kinds of substitutions\" but would check anyway. He came back, and affirmed that they couldn't put avocado on my salad unless they charged an extra $2.00. Kind of annoying. I get that if you're Terroni you can have a \"no substitutions\" policy but in this case, how about changing that policy? \n\nThe server really made an effort though, and said he'd bring over some guacamole instead. That was much appreciated :) \n\nThe hourly rentals to use the pool and ping pong tables are pretty pricey ($25\/hour) but it is a really nice space now, with nice, clean washrooms (important!), comfy seats, and lots of TVs.

Good taste, good variety on the menu, priced fair. Why does it take so long to put in my dinner order? If I have been there 5-7 times, I have had to wait to order too long maybe 5 times.

The original location was at about 52nd McDowell(it was a treat after squaw peak hike with da)( but they have been at the current location for probably the last 20 years. They have a good mix of North Indian and South Indian food. Masala dosas have always been one of my favorites things to get. The vegies and sambar are always fresh as well. The title may not say it here but they are just as famous for all the amazing sweets they make as well. Indians from all over town order it by the tray but if you arent sure what you want to order ask them to sample it. Jalebi barfi and laddu are some of my go to's.

You'll see an crowd of ASU kids definitely during cricket matches but they also have indian music videos playing throughout the day. Before I forget my favorite thing to get from there to go is pani puri!. Picture a cracker like hollow bubble with potatoes chickpeas and a spicy sauce. yes my mouth is watering just describing it.

Having tried two of the pastas and the gnocchi, my impression is that these dishes are the food version of jazz improv - discordant and overwhelming.  Like the music, I can see how the Pasta Bar dishes may appeal to many, particularly those who favor flavor intensity and\/or creativity over all else.  For my taste buds, this was overload.  Interesting yes, but I can't say I found it good.\nHere are some details:  \nPasta and gnocchi - both are quite heavy and substantial.  I prefer a more tender pasta and pillow-light gnocchi.  Maybe after running a marathon the high-density pasta would hold more appeal.\nSauces - Here is the in-your-face part.  The gnocchi sauce is spicy, overwhelmingly so for me (although I do freely admit to being a hot chili wimp).  Despite my personal intolerance to hot food, a more delicate approach would have been better.\nThe le Sarde sauce sounded interesting, mainly because I love sardines, but my taste buds could not get over the bizarre combination of strong flavors vying for attention. I could not even pick out the taste of the sardines amongst the culinary noise.  And what is with the dried hunks of bread?  I could not get beyond the oddness of this one.  \nThe carbonara was an intense combination of garlic and black pepper flavors, and probably the dish I enjoyed most of the three.  Even on this one, the garlic was out of this world in intensity.\nOn the good side, the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic - a real treat.  The atmosphere is modern and hip, while maintaining a touch of coziness.  The ingredients all appeared fresh and high quality.  And the food is indeed interesting - this is no boring spaghetti\/lasagna place.\nAs a matter of taste, I'm going to have to pass on Pasta Bar.  For the price, I'll be looking for more of a flavor symphony.  If culinary improv and high-density pasta is your thing, check it out.","date":"2009-03-01 19:50:23"}

You know you're at home, but someone's moved something, rearranged the furniture, or otherwise changed things ever so slightly but just enough to make you suspicious. This wasn't the Epicure Cafe that I remember from three or four years ago.\n\nI learned from Jackie, our cutesy server who was a total dupe for actress Clea DuVall, that a few years ago Epicure changed locations. To a few doors down farther east on Queen, on the same side of the street. Which explains the slightly-different-but-not-quite layout, decor and seating. It was a pleasant surprise. I didn't venture upstairs but I was told there's an outdoor eating area that will have to be explored on my next visit.\n\nThe menu options are, like others have said, a bit overwhelming. But for the fussy eater (I was with one of them) there was no lack of choice - Epicure has everything from pasta (17 choices, including different sauces and shapes), burgers, pizza, wraps and another full page of duck\/veal\/lamb\/chicken options. I appreciate the selection but it could stand to be honed a little! Luckily Jackie was able to recommend favourites when we showed indecision. \n\nMy eyes went straight for the Pumpkin Ravioi ($14), which I was assured was \"not a mistake\". And it wasn't. I barely looked up my from my plate as I feasted my eyes on the glorious, pillowy ravioli on my plate. They were seasoned with ginger and nutmeg, tossed in parmesan cream sauce with grilled corn, wilted spinach and mushrooms. The mushrooms were perfectly sauteed, the spinach was wilted just right and the corn was fresh and added the exact amount of crunch that the dish needed. The portion wasn't skimpy either - at some restaurants when you order jumbo ravioli you get 3-4 pieces, but this was more than double the size. Good value for the money.\n\nI was more than tempted by the dessert board (tartufo, ice cream, tiramisu, Grand Marnier cheesecake or crème caramel, Belgian chocolate mousse, apple crumble) but unfortunately dinner left me positively STUFFED. After seeing that Epicure is now open until 1 or 2am every night I know where I'll be heading for late night dessert!","date":"2009-05-20 03:22:43"}

Especially when it just hits the table, it'll have you scratching your head. Once it cools, the \"meat\" starts to get a bit of texture, but it still pretty great. If you have the thing and you can't do textures, you're probably safer sticking to something with veggies instead.\n\nAll the food I've had here has been really great, even if the service is a little shoddy. Don't let that deter you. \n\nGet the bun roll.\n\nI'm serious.","date":"2015-01-18 18:39:41"}

The penne san remo is supposed to contain artichoke but we only found two chunks of artichoke out of a container with enough food to feed 3 people. So that was disappointing. The sauce was also really bland and the chicken was overcooked\/rubbery. The stuffed shells were ok, no major issues, they just weren't worth the price.

Their pickles are actually spicy. They seems to be lightly dusted with some kind of chile powder. A nice kick follows a good bite.\n\nI ordered the Dilly something or other. It was half a sandwich (sub or panini) with a bowl of soup. I chose the Corn and Green Chile Bisque with the Sausalito Bandito panini. Delish! It also passed my spicy- enough- for- me- test. Yes, I needed multiple napkins for my nose.\nI could have taken a little more spice, so next time I might ask them to kick it up a notch, but it was a refreshing foray back to my traveling days when I tried to convince a chef in India that, no, I am actually not white. I just have REALLY light skin. Never worked.\n\nAl had the Aztec pizzeti. Coming from NY, I am particular about pizza. This looked like it fit the bill. Very think and crispy crust. A little too much cheese for my taste, but most people out here like it like that. She loved it, along with her bowl of loaded potato soup.\n\nMickey had the Gobbler with a side salad.

I got here at 3:12, sat at the bar by the tv's and then proceeded to wait for a hello or a welcome that didn't happen until finally about two minutes later. I ask about the happy hour to which the woman working responded they don't have a happy hour since they are running specials. I'm a little sad about the happy hour thing being scratched off but I have had The Otheroom to go before and was pleased with the food so I decided to look at the menu and order something good. I then wait about ten minutes before being approached and the whole time I was sitting there was a guy making drinks and nothing else. How can they have only one bartender? It's slow but it's also Memorial Day weekend and you should have enough people working. I understand people want to split your tab and whatever else but there was a third guy who could have handled whatever problem they had at the register. Anyways back to when the woman came to me she apologized for the wait which I didn't care for at that point and proceeded to order my food. Overall the experience I was expecting wasn't a good one. The food was great and a bar with great food but when the service isn't up to par it deserves a low rating. I work in high end retail and know me and many of my co workers and friends around the mall would like to be treated just like any other customer and be given a great service when we go to eat for our lunches.

We bought an air-conditioner from them in 2014 and one just last summer in 2015.  We've had nothing but problems since the very first day we had it installed.  Not only that, but the guy who comes out is completely rude and his office seems to back him up.  This is a unit which holds 5-tons of Puron so it is pretty big and it's not cheap.  We spent $5000 on the unit and it is still under warranty.  It's a good thing, too, because these people have had to replace it once and now it's compressor just blew yesterday morning.  It had been making horrible noises and shutting down and about a week ago, they came out and replaced the thermostat and the air seemed to work, but it was making an even more horrible noise than before and then 2 nights ago it stopped working altogether again.  So, it just so happens that my roommate was going to call them yesterday, anyway, to come out and fix it AGAIN.  However, before he did, all of a sudden, I heard the loudest BOOM!  I mean, it was like a bomb going off and literally was louder than a shotgun being fired close by.  Then, it had this awful constant noise - like I've never heard before and vapor was coming out of the hose by the valve and there was a funny smell and I didn't know what was going on and I panicked because I wasn't sure if it was smoke or Puron or what so I ran into the house, turned off all of the units, made sure all of our cats were okay and ran back outside real quick with fire-extinguishers just in case it was smoke.  My roommate called them and they said they'd be there within the hour.  Two hours later, a little after noon, the guy shows up and says it's the compressor that totally blew and he'd have to order another one and that they were going to charge $1200 for labor for the 5-hour job it was going to take to do it.  The compressor, itself, is still under warranty.  He tried to say that the problem was our faulty electrical and that it was on our end, therefore, they were not at all to blame for this.  Also, he said this was a completely different issue than the thermostat, which he claimed was a good call and that he did fix that problem correctly.  So, we hired an electrician (one who is extremely reputable) to come out and assess the situation because if it was our end, we knew we needed to not only get it fixed immediately for safety reasons, but I may have owed the guy an apology for insinuating this could have been their fault to begin with.  The electrician came and his findings were that #1, the units were too close to one another to begin with and that after checking the voltages, etc. with his do-hicky (LOL), his findings showed there was not one problem with our electricity, no surges or imbalanced distributions of power, no breaker problems, etc. on our end and he even called his friend who owns another air-conditioning company and his friend told him that had it been on our end it would have not only showed up in his readings, but it would have had to be a surge large enough to, at the very least, surge other electronic items in our home and that really...  it would more realistically be an outage-type surge where other neighbors would also have been affected.  Not only that, but both agreed that there's no way that it should be a 5-hour job to replace a compressor and that the money they were telling us they were going to charge was outlandish.  This electrician made a point of including some of this on the invoice and gave us the contact information of his friend in case we needed additional assistance with this matter.  Thank God for him and for Yelp and all the Yelpers out there who recommended him. :)  \n\nI'm doing this review in the hope of saving anyone out there who may be considering hiring these people for ANY reason a lot of time, headache and money.","date":"2016-08-03 23:37:42"}

I gotta say the flavours of Georgian cuisine is quite unique. These dishes seemed to be made to order because it took quite some time to receive. It may have been more than half an hour.\nMy favorite would be the hachapuri. It makes me think of having pizza but the cheese is distinctly salty and they roll up the boat edges with cheese so the crust is a delight to eat. I wish there were 2 eggs. It definitely balanced the saltiness of the cheese (feta?). It seemed like there were 2 layers of cheese: the crusty top and a layer of soft chese below.\nThe khinkali reminds me of Chinese dumplings but the flavours are truly very different from what I'm used to. It was creamy and dark. Each serving contained 3 dumplings  which doesn't seem like a lot but it really is like its own meal. It definitely needed something to cut the heaviness.\nWhile waiting for the food, we got complimentary appetizers: bread, pickled cabbage and an array of sauces (tomato, Georgian, spicy). The sauces and the pickled cabbage all have tastes I am not familiar with. I ate it all because the food was taking so long to come. The pickled cabbage I did not like so much.\nAll in all, the service was good, the food was filling and I was satisfied.","date":"2016-01-17 05:47:00"}

We went on a bike ride on the first beautiful day of the year and ended up visiting a friend in Verdun. We already know the other Comptoir 21 locations at the Latine Quarter and the Mile-End - but I like this one best. We sat outside (for the first time this year!) and really relished the last light of the day. The waitress was nice and friendly, although she was a little swamped. Once she took our order, the food came pretty fast. While we all had beer, I was actually the only one having fish and chips. My girlfriend had the veggie poutine (they have vegetarian gravy that is not bad) and our friend had a cheeseburger with fries and salad. We all enjoyed our food and I was pleasantly surprised by how calm this street is (compared to busy main streets like saint Denis or Mont-Royal where it's not as nice to sit out in the street). I was also glad for the opportunity to sit outside because sitting inside on the bar makes it harder to have a conversation when more than two people are involved, plus there is a lot of oil in the air near the kitchen.  We went to pay inside and discovered they only accept debit and cash :( but overall this is a good place to have a good time!","date":"2016-05-07 02:11:26"}

How can that be? The Lotus Garden has been around for 60 years and there's no question as to why. The food is fantastic and the staff is very friendly and accomodating.\n\nMy meal always starts out with an egg roll. These are no ordinary egg rolls...they're not tiny, and aren't considered one of those side items tossed in as an afterthought as at most Chinese restaurants. No - these egg rolls could be a meal! Filled with baby shrimp, cabbage, and carrots, the filling is tender with a bit of a crunch. The wrapper isn't your typical thin, fried, \"papery skin\". The wrapper is a bit more substantial because of the size of the egg roll..yet it's crisp on the outside and a little chewy on the inside. The best egg rolls I've ever eaten.\n\nI also like to order the fried pork dumplings. They're pretty basic as pork dumplings go, but they have a great flavor and the dipping sauce is very good. I'm pretty picky about my dumpling sauce. I don't like it too salty or too sweet. This is just perfect with a touch of heat.\n\nMy main course staple is the chicken with garlic sauce. This is noted on the menu as a spicy item. The Thai red pepper flakes give it the right amount of heat without overpowering the garlic brown sauce. It's a simple dish with slivers of white meat chicken, slivered water chestnuts, and a few mushrooms tossed in for good measure. This dish is so flavorful that you don't need anything else. I love the chicken paired with the crunch of the water chestnuts. They both take on the flavor of the sauce quite well. \n\nOther great dishes are the chicken lo mein, General Tso's Chicken, and chicken with broccoli.\n\nPlus the atmosphere is welcoming and cozy. No need for takeout!","date":"2009-05-19 17:41:51"}

The kiddo had the pepperoni flatbread which sounded like a horribly boring choice, but hey, what can I expect taking a moody tweenager who hates seafood to a crab shack!  The place was packed!  And for good reason!  It was our first trip there, but certainly won't be our last!","date":"2016-01-17 05:33:14"}

The remodel after Buttita's is as good as one can do when turning a lovely restaurant into a sports bar-style restaurant (though why one would want to do that is beyond me).  And that's where the good stuff stops.\nIn short, the service and all things related to it were glacially slow; the food, when it arrived, was mediocre at best -- and missing key elements (one whole order, and other parts).  This restaurant cannot possibly last if they don't figure out how to greet and serve customers, or get the food that was ordered actually to the tables.\nThe full story.\nUpon arrival, we found a vacant hostess stand, then a long walk down the hall to the dining room along which we saw no one who works there.  Luckily, we ran into friends who assured us that we could seat ourselves.\nAfter waiting at our table for some 15 minutes, we used a bit of self-help, and accosted a waitress to ask for some menus.  After another 5-7 minutes another waitress finally showed up with menus and silverware. She did not offer water, or to bring us a drink of any sort - just plopped the menus down and disappeared.\nQuite some time later, our waitress arrived, apologetically, and took our order.  We ordered an appetizer (cheese fries), and three meals: 1 burger (would have been on wheat bread but despite the menu, they had none), one 1\/2 ribeye (which the menu says was supposed to be thick, but which was certainly not), that should have come with some interesting sounding twice baked potato casserole, and one individual pizza.  My daughter ordered a diet, I ordered water, and my husband ordered a beer.\nThe water and diet only took about 7 minutes to arrive.\nThe appetizer might have arrived after another 10, but the food runner carrying the plate of cheese fries tried to deliver them to another table. Having learned he had the wrong table, the lad just took them back to the kitchen.\nEventually, the cheese fries arrived.  They weren't as hot as one would like, and for the price, there should have been a LOT more cheese.  The fries were no better than I could make using frozen crinkle fries from the grocery.\nWithin 3 minutes of the appetizer's tardy arrival, some of our food arrived.\nThe burger (but not the beer), and my steak with vegetable, but no potato casserole, and no pizza.\nThe waitress arrived, and asked if everything was there, we told her \"no\", and pointed out that we were missing the beer, the potatoes and the pizza.  Ten minutes later the beer arrived.\nMy husband then went up to the window where the pizza would have been put up for a food runner -- no pizza had been ordered.\nSo. \nThe steak was fatty, but moderately tasty, if only tepid.  The broccoli was cold, the burger was not as good as you can get at, say Hardee's (despite costing twice as much). \nWe never did get the pizza.  Or the potatoes.  \nI DID offer to come in as a consulting manager to help them teach the staff how to actually wait tables......","date":"2013-12-07 02:26:13"}

I concur with the commenter who noted that the parking situation is difficult.  However, being close to I-15 and Spring Mountain is a huge advantage for me, and it is open 24 hours.\n\nA relatively new member of the staff is Tony, who recently left Saigon 8.  The guy is terrific, and I've seen him iron out the bumps when language is a problem.  He's the reason I came to this restaurant in the first place.\n\nI've had pho twice and vermicelli with grilled pork, spicy (#68) once.  The pho broth was pretty good (not quite Saigon 8, but not bad), and the meat, etc., was also good.  The #68 was the best thing I've had there, and it is served in a bowl rather than a plate, which I think helped.  The restaurant was jam packed (Friday, about 1:30 p.m.), but service went smoothly.  By the time I was finished, I would say about two thirds of the crowd had left after eating.\n\nAt the table, There was hoisin sauce and Sriracha hot sauce, plus fish sauce and soy sauce.  There was also a jar of a pepper sauce that looked like a Szechuan sauce, but didn't have the heat.  There were plain wooden chop sticks, which I like, spoons, and small saucers, which I use to mix a dip.  I've mentioned in my Jenny Pho review that this is the way I prefer it, instead of bringing stuff out with the pho, and using lacquered chop sticks.\n\nOne thing you should know is that there is a sign that says cash only.  That changed a couple of months ago.  They allow major credit cards (Visa, MC), but they left the sign up.\n\nI like the restaurant for the quality of the food, which is pretty good, location, near I-15, and the fact that Tony now works here, and he's terrific.\n\nSomething I should have said earlier:  Pho Little Saigon makes its own Vietnamese sandwiches.  I brought some home, and they're very good.  Pho Saigon 8 doesn't  make its own, though there's a shop that makes them out the rear of their parking lot.","date":"2014-11-30 01:24:25"}

Than Joes Farm Grill is the place for you. Even if you have simple tastes Joes Farm Grill will have something to suit your needs.  It has beautiful decoration, great food and affordable prices, so why not pay a visit. \nJoes Farm Grill has a long historical background, with a house originally built in 1966 by the Johnston family. In later years it was decided to turn the farm into a restaurant with its food being home grown or locally brought in. The house development around the farm is Agritopia, and was dedicated to permanent urban farming. In fact if you live in the development surrounding the restaurant you can rent a garden lot to grow vegetables.  All of their products are certified USDA organic, and their focus is common food done uncommonly. They feel fresh food taste better and are better for you so why not share all that with the customers. They take the foods taste to a new level with all of the recipes and ingredients. \nJoes Farm Grill is delicious, unique and a fun experience. I feel most restaurants are chains and don't have the history behind them like Joes does, and because of this it makes the experience much more special. Knowing your food is organic makes it taste ten times better, and knowing you don't have to spend a fortune for organic makes me want to go again. It's really stands out among most and everyone in the chandler area needs to stop by and visit. \n First walking up to the twelve acre masterpiece is like going through a farm, with orange trees covering the path and large oaks surrounding it which gives a beautiful green glow of a garden.  It smells fresh and gives you an earthy vive. They are enormous and full of green vegetables that look extremely appetizing. They are covering most of the land and you can walk through them and see your food growing.  The building is white with large windows showing the back and the front equally, and the inside has simple decorations with light blue and green accents not to overpower the beauty of the vegetation growing outside. It holds no more than a hundred people and is rather spacious seating. The entire restaurant is very simple with a 60s feel mixed with a futuristic time. I ordered the jumbo breaded shrimp with fries, French toast banana peanut butter sandwich and the barbeque chicken pizza. I went with my sister because the portions are rather large and I could not have eaten it by myself. This was my first time visiting the restaurant and my sisters second. Everything so far was very pleasant and the employees were very nice. No more than ten minutes later our food was ready and it looked and smelt great. We sat down and I tried each dish, starting with the shrimp which were very large. The shrimp was crunchy and juicy and was simple and not overpowering. I thought it tasted very good and wasn't too rich which is a problem I normally find when ordering shrimp. Then I tried the French toast peanut butter sandwiches that surprisingly had strawberry's in it too. This was one of the best tasting things I have ever had! It was a house specialty and lives up to its name. It tasted like a gourmet peanut butter sandwich and was so flavorful and sweet. I had to order another one. Then I tried the barbeque pizza, I liked it but it wasn't my favorite. It was thin crust and slightly burnt, but it did taste good with the cheese and chicken combination. It just tasted like there was too many ingredients on the pizza that overpowered it. The prices weren't that bad either, the shrimp was the most expensive at 14.99 when I go again I probably won't order this again, just because it wasn't a to die for dish.  The peanut butter sandwiches were 10.99 and I crave these every day it was amazing! Than last the pizza was 12.99, my sister liked it more than I did so it depends on your taste but I probably will try something else. \nThe most important part though is the food, and not to leave you hanging was no matter what spectacular. Fresh fries galore. The most appealing part to me was the decorations and the gardens surrounding the place. I think the set up as if you're in a food court is a really interesting concept; you have to throw away your own food on trays, and clean up after yourself. I didn't expect that and I think it's a smart move on the restaurants part.  The calm and relaxing atmosphere, and no rush pace is really nice. \nI enjoyed Joes Farm Grill and I plan on visiting again. I think the organic concept and urban farming is a really nice thing to hear about in today's society. I feel better knowing I'm eating organic, and knowing there are still places that are going strong with the idea of organic. I hope the success of this restaurant shows others they can do the same. This restaurant meets all my needs as a customer, clean, green and tasty what more could you want.","date":"2012-06-25 23:41:20"}

Cue Club is large inside and out. Like how can they use this much space? The bartender gave us the lowdown as soon as we walked in: the building is divided into smoking and non smoking and each have either quarter tables or pay by the hour tables. Apparently you can only do pay by the hour if you're a pro. We chose the non smoking side and there were 2-3 other tables being used at the time. The jukebox was surprisingly really good until someone chose to play their own tunes. We did end up smelling like cigarette smoke afterwards. Not sure if this is from hanging out in the smoking area initially or if it's so overpowering that it gets into the non smoking area. They also have shuffleboard and a few carnival style games like skee ball. Knowing that most any billiards hall in Vegas is going to be equally smoky I think I'd rather come here and know your chances of getting a table are pretty good and they're at least attempting to offer a non smoking option.","date":"2018-10-04 17:47:38"}

However, it paled in comparison to many of the 2-starred venues.  The prices are obscene first of all - about double what I've grown accustomed to paying for a  similar experience (even the champagne).  Not to mention, the bites and bubbles menu at Guy Savoy we had tackled two nights prior was MUCH more affordable and more enjoyable.\n\nOur standard 5 course menu began with what was really  an oversized amuse bouche, a chopped apple with spices served in a glass wrapped with pictures of apples.  Good but not worthy of being called an appetizer.  The next dish was cold, shaved foie gras and thin slices of black truffles arranged in a salad.  The truffle slices were old or improperly stored and had absolutely no flavor.  I absolutely love truffles and should have sent it back; huge disappointment.  The foie gras was excellent however.  \n\nThe main courses were a boring fish cooked in a unneccesarily huge iron pot and some wagyu steak.  The quality of the steak was amazing, much like the one time I've had authentic prime wagyu before where I was charged far less for the pleasure. \n\n The one saving grace of the meal was dessert..  The presentation of a shiny, glittery ball that melted upon contact with a warm sauce was spectacular.  The dessert trolley offered a wide selection of expertly prepared mignardises.  The free take-home box of chocolates was a nice touch.    Service was great but not exceptional and the tables were packed too closely.  \n\nOverall, Robuchon is hardly deserving of 3 michelin stars based on our one experience, though your mileage may vary .  I feel that it was all style over substance and that may be fine for fashion bu not for food.  At half the price, I'd have been more forgiving (3-4 stars), but I felt cheated and given the many other excellent restaurants in Vegas, I don't feel there's any reason to visit Robuchon.  And I say this having gone in with a very positive attitutide after dining at L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon in Paris, which was exceptional all around.  If you do go to Robuchon, my one piece of advice is to go a la cart, which I didn't realize was an option and seemed almost reasonable.","date":"2009-10-13 15:01:50"}

However, in their second race they put the pedal to the metal and tested the limits of their speed-limited carts.\n\nThe adults took the big carts for a run and I was lucky to be racing with novices and took the checkered flag in one of the two races. I was foiled by a \"pile up\" in one of the races which killed my lap average. :) My lovely wife took a nice stroll around the course and it was fun to wave as I zipped by.\n\nThe service was excellent. The track-workers were hilarious. All in all a great experience. \n\n** note ** Our first attempt to race was marred by the company Groupon and their multi-hour outage in March 2015. We did not print the groupon, we couldn't pull it up on our phones, and they had no way to help us over the phone (30+ min wait to tell us that). Clearly this had nothing to do with K1, and they were trying to help us, and other than just giving us the races for free I'm not sure they could have done more.","date":"2015-04-28 19:04:54"}

I have received sports massages, Swedish and deep tissue. I consider La Vida to be a very good facility and Angel to be a very competent therapist. For more than 6 months I have gone once every 3-4 weeks.\n\nI work out regularly and consider a massage a great way to heal sore muscles and low back pain from sitting at a desk all day. After my old therapist moved to Florida, I began the annoying process of trying new ones. Some have trouble dialing up or down the pressure. Some can't get the low back pain out like others. Some reek of cigarette smoke. Some are lazy, using one hand at a time instead of two.\n\nThen I found Angel, who is quite competent. If you wanna chat, she'll chat. If you want quiet relaxation, she'll put you at ease. If you say \"I hurt here\", she will solve it. I consider one of Angel's attributes to be the fact she can dial up or down pressure just BARELY, and maintain that. She can find where it hurts and, due to her through knowledge of fascia and layers of tissue, massage the pain away. After repeat sessions, she understands I need more pressure on the right side of my spine than my left. Angel's ability to meet her clients needs combined with her through knowledge of muscle and fascia along with the ability to maintain consistent pressure make her an extremely competent therapist.\n\nIf Angel is busy or sick, Ivan is a fantastic alternative. He's an A in my book, with Angel an A+. Edit: Forgot to mention, Ivan's strengths are deep tissue and neck work. If your neck specifically is killing you or you need real deep tissue, Ivan is your man.\n\nLa Vida is an upper middle \/ yuppie chain massage location with ample parking. I feel strongly that these are superior to middle brow chain massage places (such as Massage Envy) and superior to upscale spas (such as Sewickly or Seven Springs or Esspa). Simply put, La Vida has lots of returning clients and as such, a steady stream of business and competent and calm massage therapists with little turnover.","date":"2014-02-05 20:28:23"}

The hotel also offers a 4 p.m. late checkout for no additional charge, which was perfect since we were out until 4 a.m. the night before.\n\nMy complaints are extremely minor: no call-down service for the valet (but the wait was usually only about 10 minutes), no free WiFi ($12\/day is a little steep and I felt it should have been included), no additional toiletries like mouthwash or toothpaste and the shampoo\/conditioner wasn't very high quality. Boyfriend also thought there should be some sort of rubber mat for the shower, since it was all marble and was very slippery once wet. My only other comment is that the lobby is a little bit gauche (but, it's Vegas...what lobby isn't?!).\n\nAll in all, I thought this was a FANTASTIC value and, as I said, the best bed I've experienced in my life. I will definitely be back.\n\np.s. in response to those who say it's \"off the Strip,\" it's not. It's on the older part of the Strip (near Circus Circus), but it's not technically \"off-Strip.\"  Also, when it's 110 degrees outside, I don't know who is actually WALKING from casino to casino, anyway!!! Seriously? Doesn't everyone take a cab everywhere?","date":"2009-08-04 01:11:02"}
